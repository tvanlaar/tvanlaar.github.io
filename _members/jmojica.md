For my research, I am working with a medically relevant bacterial species called <i>Salmonella enterica</i> Serovar Typhimurium. I will be deleting two genes called <i>gshA</i> and <i>luxS</i> from the genome and then determining how the gene deletions influence virulent properties of the bacteria. I will be evaluating biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, motility, quorum sensing, and infection/ death rates using a greater wax moth as a model system. 
 
In my free time, I enjoy going to concerts, going on walks, and seeing documentaries!
