I graduated from CSU Stanislaus with a BS in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Molecular and Microbial Biology. My research interests include anything with infectious diseases and the immune system of those infected. My MSc project is focused on the influence that Avian Malaria has on the immune system and gut microbiome in White-crowned Sparrows, who migrate here in the Central Valley for the Winter. My approach will be using molecular and microscopy techniques, and bioinformatics to determine a correlation, if any, between malaria, the immune system, and gut microbiome.

When I am not in the lab, I enjoy exploring new scenery with my horse, spending time with my family and friends, or staying in and binge-watching a long overdue series, or cozied up and reading books.
