I am in my third year as a faculty member at Stan State and I am so excited to be a Warrior again! My research interests include birds, bioinformatics, and bacteria in any combination. I really enjoying teaching and helping students figure out new things about biology they may have never considered as an interest before.

In my "free time", I love spending time with family. We enjoy traveling, birding, and relaxing together. We have 5 chickens (including a noisy boi), 3 cats, and a miniature dachshund named Barney.

My proudest recent accomplishment is my awesome sourdough starter. I'm now taking name suggestions. :P
