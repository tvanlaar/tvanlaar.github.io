Iâ€™m a first-year undergraduate at Stanislaus State University, and I work as a research assistant investigating the impact of avian malaria on the immune system and gut microbiome of White-crowned Sparrows. My favorite part of working in the lab is constantly learning new things and getting to use my knowledge in practical applications!

I have too many hobbies to enumerate, but some of my current favorites are watercolor painting, digital art, rock climbing, recipe development, and playing my violin. I also love reading books, hanging out with my family, and meeting new people.
