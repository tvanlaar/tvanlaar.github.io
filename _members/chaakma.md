I will be knocking out the <i>iutA</i> gene in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, an opportunistic pathogen that frequents itself in immunocompromised individuals. The deletion of <i>iutA</i> disrupts the bacterium’s ability to sequester iron via the aerobactin siderophore pathway, which is an important virulence factor for its survival and persistence in its host organism.  I will be researching the effect of deleting this gene and its impact on siderophore-mediated iron acquisition.  If the knockout of this gene attenuates <i>K. pneumoniae</i>’s pathogenicity and colonization, then this can reveal a potential antimicrobial target in antibiotic resistance strains.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my dog (a dalmatian!) and hanging out with friends.
