Hi! I am a second year MSBS candidate. I am working with Dr. Van Laar to study the gut microbiome of urban songbirds using a combination of wet lab and computational methods. In addition to microbiology, I am interested in STEM education. 

In my free time I enjoy playing tennis, cooking, and hanging out with my dog, Luke.
