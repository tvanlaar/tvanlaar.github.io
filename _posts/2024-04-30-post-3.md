April has been a good month for the Van Laar lab! Dr. Van Laar was awarded a $15,000 CSUBIOTECH grant for her collaborative work with Dr. Slade (Fresno State) on malaria, the microbiome, and the immune response in white-crowned sparrows. Speaking of that project...Alejandra will be presenting her results at the American Ornithological Society Meeting in Estes Park, CO, in October!
